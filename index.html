                <hr/>
                <p>My name is Daniel Taliun, and I am an Assistant Professor in the <a href="https://www.mcgill.ca/humangenetics/">Department of Human Genetics</a> at McGill University in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montreal">Montreal, Canada</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="https://www.genomic-medicine-cerc.online/">McGill CERC Program in Genomic Medicine</a>, where I lead research efforts in computational genomics. I did my Ph.D. in Computer Science, developing computational algorithms and analytical tools for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genome-wide_association_study">genetic association studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms</a>. As genetic technologies improve, I further expand my research interests to meet new challenges in data analysis raised by new types of genetic data and genetic experiments. What excites me about my work is the data variety and size and the <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/456018a">unsolved puzzles</a> of how our genes impact our health. My goal is to pass on all my experience and excitement about this field to all trainees working in my team.</p>
